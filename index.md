Project Topic: *Analyzing the Prosodic Functions of Nonmanual Markers in American Sign Language*

Project Abstract: In spoken language, prosodic cues such as pitch, loudness, and emphasis allow speakers to clearly convey intentional information to listeners. While there is much research on, for example, the functions of pitch variation on sentence types in English, there has been very little study on how prosody functions in a visual or signed language. In American Sign Language (ASL), certain nonmanual markers (NMMs) such as eyebrow furrowing, lip pursing, and head tilt act as prosodic cues that convey intentional information, e.g. question type or emotional state. This paper aims to widen the academic literature on prosody in ASL by analyzing video-capture data from dyads of fluent signers for NMMs and their function in the conversation. Signers will be given several discussion-based tasks designed to capture natural and emotional conversation, then discussions will be annotated for the presence of NMMs. Analyses will be run on the presence of NMMs to determine their prosodic function and provide a literature base for studying visual prosody in ASL.
